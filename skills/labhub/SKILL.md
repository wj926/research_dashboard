# LabHub Skill

You are the LabHub agent. The user invoked you because they want to
interact with LabHub (https://labhub.damilab.cc), an internal research
dashboard with a JWT-authenticated REST API.

## Constants

```
LABHUB_URL    = https://labhub.damilab.cc   (or $LABHUB_URL env override)
CLIENT_ID     = Ov23li51RQ8mtKGwzr5z
TOKEN_FILE    = $HOME/.config/labhub/token.json
SCRIPTS_DIR   = (this skill folder)/scripts
```

If the user has set `LABHUB_URL` in their environment, use that instead
of the default. This lets a developer point at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Step 1: Classify the user's intent

Pick exactly one based on what the user said:

| User said something like… | Intent |
|---|---|
| "login", "sign in", "로그인" | `login` |
| "logout", "sign out", "로그아웃" | `logout` |
| "me", "who am I", "내 정보", "토큰 살아있나" | `whoami` |
| "start a run", "X 프로젝트에 Y run 시작", "create a run" | `run.start` |
| "the run finished/succeeded/failed/cancelled", "그 run 끝났어/취소", "mark X as Y" | `run.update` |

If the request doesn't clearly match, ask a brief clarifying question.
**Never guess on intent.**

## Step 2: Auth precheck (skip for `login` intent)

For every intent except `login`, before making an API call:

1. Read `$TOKEN_FILE`. If missing → tell user `"✗ Not logged in. Run /labhub login."` and stop.
2. JSON-parse the file. If parse fails → delete the file, tell user `"✗ Token file corrupted. Run /labhub login again."` and stop.
3. Compare `expiresAt` (ISO timestamp) to current time. If expired → tell user `"✗ Token expired. Run /labhub login to refresh."` and stop.

Only proceed if all three checks pass. The token field is the JWT to send as `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.

## Step 3: Execute the intent

### `login`

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/labhub"
EXCHANGE=$(bash "$SCRIPTS_DIR/device-flow.sh" "$CLIENT_ID" "$LABHUB_URL")
echo "$EXCHANGE" > "$HOME/.config/labhub/token.json"
chmod 600 "$HOME/.config/labhub/token.json"
```

Read back `member.login` and `member.displayName` from the saved file.
Print to user:
```
✓ Logged in as <displayName> (@<login>)
  Token saved to ~/.config/labhub/token.json (expires <expiresAt>)
```

If `device-flow.sh` exits non-zero, surface its stderr and stop.

### `logout`

```bash
rm -f "$HOME/.config/labhub/token.json"
```

Print: `✓ Logged out (token deleted).`
The JWT remains valid until its `expiresAt`; this only removes the local copy. Anyone with the saved token (e.g., a backup) could still use it until it expires.

### `whoami`

```bash
TOKEN=$(node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('$HOME/.config/labhub/token.json','utf8'))['token'])")
RESP=$(curl -fsS "$LABHUB_URL/api/me" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN")
LOGIN=$(node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(process.argv[1]).login)" -- "$RESP")
DISPLAY=$(node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(process.argv[1]).displayName)" -- "$RESP")
ROLE=$(node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(process.argv[1]).role)" -- "$RESP")
```

Print: `✓ Logged in as <displayName> (@<login>) — role: <role>`.
Map errors per Step 4.

### `run.start`

Required from user: `name` and `projectSlug`. If either is missing,
ask once: `"어느 프로젝트의 어떤 이름의 run인가요?"`. Don't guess.

Optional: `summary` (short text) and `durationSec` (rare for a starting
run, but allowed).

Construct the body with `node -e` so user text in `name`/`slug`/`summary`
is JSON-escaped safely:

```bash
TOKEN=$(node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('$HOME/.config/labhub/token.json','utf8'))['token'])")
BODY=$(node -e 'console.log(JSON.stringify({name:process.argv[1],projectSlug:process.argv[2],status:"in_progress",...(process.argv[3]?{summary:process.argv[3]}:{}),...(process.argv[4]?{durationSec:Number(process.argv[4])}:{})}))' -- "<name>" "<slug>" "<summary or empty>" "<durationSec or empty>")
curl -fsS -X POST "$LABHUB_URL/api/runs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "$BODY"
```

The actor (`triggeredByLogin`) is always the JWT holder. You cannot log a run on behalf of someone else — there is no API field for that.

On 201 success, parse `id` from response and print:
```
✓ Started <id> (<slug> / <name>)
  $LABHUB_URL/projects/<slug>/experiments/<id>
```

On 404 `project_not_found`: surface `hint` from response, and if a near-miss slug is plausible (typo of an existing one), suggest it.

### `run.update`

Required: `id` (the run to update) and `status`.
Optional: `durationSec`, `summary`.

To resolve `id` when the user says "the run", "그 run", "it", "마지막 run":
look in the **current Claude Code conversation only** for the most recent
`id` printed by a *successful* `run.start` (a `✓ Started exp-…` line you
yourself printed in this conversation). If the conversation is fresh, the
prior `run.start` failed, or no such line exists, ask:
`"어느 run 인가요? id를 알려주세요 (예: exp-te35xn)"`.

Status mapping (natural language → API value):
- "성공" / "success" / "잘 됐어" / "completed" → `success`
- "실패" / "failure" / "터졌어" / "failed" → `failure`
- "취소" / "cancelled" / "cancel" → `cancelled`
- "큐" / "queued" / "대기" → `queued`
- (no status in request, but it's a `run.update` intent) → ask, don't default

If the natural language is ambiguous ("그저그래"), ask: `"성공/실패/취소 중 어떤 상태인가요?"`.

Duration mapping: parse natural language to seconds.
- `"1시간"` / `"1h"` → 3600
- `"30분"` / `"30m"` → 1800
- `"2h 10m"` → 7800
- not mentioned → don't include `durationSec` in the body

```bash
BODY=$(node -e 'const fields={};const a=process.argv;if(a[1])fields.status=a[1];if(a[2])fields.durationSec=Number(a[2]);if(a[3])fields.summary=a[3];console.log(JSON.stringify(fields))' -- "<status or empty>" "<durationSec or empty>" "<summary or empty>")
curl -fsS -X PATCH "$LABHUB_URL/api/runs/<id>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "$BODY"
```

On 200, print:
```
✓ Marked <id> as <status> (<duration if known>, "<summary if any>")
```

## Step 4: Error response handling

The LabHub API returns `{ "error": "<code>", "hint"?: "<text>" }` on
non-2xx. Map by status + code:

| Status | error code | Show user |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | `missing_token` | `✗ Not logged in. Run /labhub login.` |
| 401 | `invalid_token` | `✗ Invalid token. Run /labhub login.` |
| 401 | `expired_token` | `✗ Token expired. Run /labhub login to refresh.` |
| 401 | `unknown_member` | `✗ Token member not found in LabHub. Contact admin.` |
| 401 | `github_verify_failed` | `✗ GitHub rejected the access token. Try /labhub login again.` |
| 400 | `invalid_request` | Show hint verbatim, name the missing field. |
| 404 | `project_not_found` | Show hint. If a near-miss slug is plausible, suggest it. |
| 404 | `run_not_found` | `✗ Run id not found. Double-check the id.` |
| any | (network error / 5xx) | `✗ Cannot reach LabHub at <URL>. Check status and try again.` |

When showing an error, prefix with `✗ ` and stop. Do not retry automatically.

## Step 5: Disambiguation policy (read once)

- Required field missing → ask once, briefly. Don't guess.
- Status word ambiguous → ask which of (success/failure/cancelled).
- "the run" with no recent run id → ask for id.
- Multiple plausible projects matching slug → ask which.
- Token expired mid-flow → don't auto-rerun login. Surface and stop.
- 5 runs requested in one message → make 5 sequential POST calls; print
  each result as it lands; on first failure stop and report which
  succeeded so far.

**Bias toward asking over guessing. The user can always answer one
question; recovering from a bogus run created by a wrong guess is harder.**
